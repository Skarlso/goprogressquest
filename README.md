Go Progress Quest
=================

This will be a Go Implementation of the famous type of RPG, called:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Quest

See it in action here:

This will be an API which can be consumed by any client in a number of ways.

Example usage
-------------

```bash
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"awesome"}' http://localhost:8989/api/1/create
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"awesome"}' http://localhost:8989/api/1/start
```

This will start adventuring for character ```awesome```. Multiple characters can be sent adventuring. But after a while the log will be unreadable. Later, I might create a web front-end for this project which will be able to track multiple characters at once.

And once you think your character adventured enough, simply call stop.

```bash
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"awesome"}' http://localhost:8989/api/1/stop
```

Installing
==========

GoProgressQuest uses mongodb for it's back-end storage. The storage medium is interfaced, so any kind of database can be plugged in and used if you implement these three functions:

```go
// Storage defines a storage medium. It could be anything that implements this interface.
type Storage interface {
	Save(Character) error
	Load(ID string) (Character, error)
	Update(Character) error
}
```

```
Return:
```json

Running it
----------

```bash
go build
```

Currently the project is simple enough so that no Makefile is needed for this process.
